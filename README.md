# Box Game (Eight-Faces)

This is a little task I constructed for a member of our Discord channel as a means to practice web-development.

Figured I would create a rendition also to be used as a potential comparison.

Box Game Exercise:
[You work for a new digital agency. Your project manager has told you that the new BIG THING is the onMouseOver event. The agency have suggested that writing the application in React/Vue is preferable but not required. The functionality that the MVP product should produce is as follows:]
- The user should hit a landing page, which displays 8 faces.
- Every time the mouse hovers over one of the faces, a caption that either already exists or appears upon the first time the face it mouse overed, should increase as a counter. From 0 to a maximum of 10.
- When a face has reached a mouse over value of 10, it should display "Most popular face" as a caption. At the time that a most popular face is given, lock all other increases.
- There is also an optional requirement to allow the user to click one of the faces displayed, and thus increase the counter by the mouse over value and a further 2.
- There should be an mandatory option for the user to reset all counters displayed on the page.
- The project manager said it would also be nice (but absolutely don't spend too much time on the subject) to output the current id of all faces and their current hover/click score to a json file.
